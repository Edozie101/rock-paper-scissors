# Rock, Paper, Scissors ++

We are going to build and test a command line app that does Rock, Paper, Scissors.

Testing command line applications is hard because we are getting and printing
things out to the system. We need to find a ways to inspect or divert that process in order to test our application.

Before trying this on your own, you should have seen a lecture where we did this together. If not, use the assessment, todo-cli, as a reference for writing tests.

#### Gems

It only comes with the 'rspec' gem for testing. It also comes with files that
set the ruby version and the gemset. Once you pull down this project once, and
bundle gems, you shouldn't have to do it again. Your computer should just know
which Ruby and gemset to use.

## Getting Started

1. `bundle` to get your gems
2. Build a system abstraction to make testing easier, in lecture, together
3. Test your real logic, and then make the tests pass one at at time
